# Query options

When you execute a query, options control how the query is executed. `ApolloClient` returns an `ApolloResponse` that satisfies the options or an exceptional response otherwise (`response.exception` is not null).

## `fetchPolicy`

Fetch policy controls how and if the cache is used. The default is `CacheFirst`.

### `CacheFirst`

A response is fetched from the cache first. If no valid response cannot be found, the network is queried.

### `CacheOnly`

The response is fetched from the cache. If no valid response cannot be found, `response.exception` is set.

### `NetworkOnly`

The response is fetched from the network. If no valid response cannot be found, `response.exception` is set.

### `NetworkFirst`

A response is fetched from the network first. If no valid response cannot be found, the cache is queried.

## `serverErrorsAsCacheMisses`

Sets whether GraphQL errors in the cache should be treated as cache misses. When true (the default), if any field is an Error in the cache, the returned response will have a null data and a non-null exception of type `ApolloGraphQLException`.

## `throwOnCacheMiss`

Sets whether missing fields from the cache should result in an exception. When true (the default), if any field is missing in the cache, the returned response will have a null data and a non-null exception of type `CacheMissException`.

Set this to false to allow partial responses from the cache, where _some_ or _all_ of the fields may be missing.

## `maxStale`

If stale fields are acceptable up to a certain value, you can set a maximum staleness duration. This duration is the maximum time that a stale field will be resolved without resulting in a cache miss. To set this duration, call [`.maxStale(Duration)`](https://apollographql.github.io/apollo-kotlin-normalized-cache/kdoc/normalized-cache/com.apollographql.cache.normalized/max-stale.html?query=fun%20%3CT%3E%20MutableExecutionOptions%3CT%3E.maxStale(maxStale:%20Duration):%20T) either globally on your client, or per operation:

```kotlin
val response = client.query(MyQuery())
    .fetchPolicy(FetchPolicy.CacheOnly)
    .maxStale(1.hours)
    .execute()
```

### `isStale`

With `maxStale`, it is possible to get data from the cache even if it is stale. To know if the response contains stale fields, you can check [`CacheInfo.isStale`](https://apollographql.github.io/apollo-kotlin-normalized-cache/kdoc/normalized-cache/com.apollographql.cache.normalized/-cache-info/is-stale.html):

```kotlin
if (response.cacheInfo?.isStale == true) {
  // The response contains at least one stale field
}
```
